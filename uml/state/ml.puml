StateEngine --> MLAI : Provides World State Data
ReactiveSolver --> MLAI : Supplies Historical Solver Data
MLAI --> MLAI : Trains Model on Past Data
MLAI --> Solver : Predicts Optimal Solver Parameters
Solver --> Solver : Executes Optimization
Solver --> User : Returns Optimized Solution

' Error Handling
MLAI --> Solver : Model Confidence Low? (Use Default Parameters)

' Feedback Loop
Solver --> MLAI : Sends Performance Metrics
MLAI --> MLAI : Retrains Model
